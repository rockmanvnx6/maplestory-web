Hey, ducklings! Thanks for downloading this resource pack! Below are a couple things to remember when using this:

~ All clouds are from Maplestory, Nexon.
~ Please do not redistribute this pack!
~ "Day" clouds are ones that are brighter and more pastel. "Night" clouds are darker, and "sunset" clouds have hues of oranges and reds. This was just my way of organizing them, but feel free to use them however you'd like.

I apologize if any clouds are repeated several times throughout the pack; it's hard to keep track of them!

Thank you!
